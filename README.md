### Cities Forget. CityLearn Remembers.

AI-Powered Traffic Institutional Memory System for Event-Driven Congestion Management

---

##  Problem Statement

Urban traffic authorities face recurring congestion caused by:

* Political Rallies
* Festivals
* Sports Events
* Construction Activities
* Vehicle Breakdowns
* Accidents
* Sudden Public Gatherings

Despite years of operational experience, traffic response strategies are often:

 * Experience-driven

 * Poorly documented

 * Not reusable

 * Lacking post-event learning

As a result, cities repeatedly solve the same traffic problems without learning from previous incidents.

---

#  Our Solution

CityLearn is a self-learning traffic intelligence platform that transforms historical traffic incidents into operational knowledge.

Instead of treating every traffic disruption as a new problem, CityLearn learns from thousands of past events and recommends the best response strategy for future incidents.

The platform acts as an institutional memory system for traffic authorities.

#  CityLearn Engine

Every traffic event is converted into a unique fingerprint using:

* Event Type
* Event Cause
* Corridor
* Police Station
* Zone
* Priority
* Road Closure Requirement
* Time of Day
* Day of Week

Example:

Event Type: Vehicle Breakdown
Cause: Engine Failure
Corridor: Mysore Road
Police Station: Byatarayanapura
Priority: Medium
Road Closure: False
Hour: 09

This fingerprint is transformed into vector embeddings using Sentence Transformers.

---

#  Similar Event Retrieval

When a new event occurs, CityLearn searches historical records and retrieves the most similar incidents.

Outputs include:

* Top Similar Events
* Similarity Scores
* Common Causes
* Recommended Police Station
* Recommended Corridor
* Historical Outcomes

This enables traffic operators to leverage past operational knowledge instantly.

---

#  Impact Prediction Engine

CityLearn predicts operational impact before traffic conditions worsen.

Current Prediction Models:

### Road Closure Prediction

Predicts:

* Whether road closure is required
* Probability of closure

Model Accuracy:

**93%+ Accuracy**

Features Used:

* Event Type
* Corridor
* Police Station
* Priority
* Event Cause
* Time Features

---

#  Recommendation Engine

Using historical similarity and prediction outputs, CityLearn recommends:

### Manpower Deployment

Suggested police station and response area

### Barricading Strategy

Whether barricades should be deployed

### Congestion Risk

* Low
* Moderate
* High

### Operational Actions

Examples:

* Monitor Traffic Flow
* Deploy Barricades Early
* Increase Police Presence
* Activate Diversion Plan
